Worms 2 Color Map Generator

</h1>

Generates color maps for Worms 2 using custom images that can be played on using [CTerrain](https://github.com/Carlmundo/CTerrain).

Playing on color maps generated by this tool requires running W2ColormapGen at least once, so it generates a sky gradient theme to be used in-game.
